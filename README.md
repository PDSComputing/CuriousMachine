# CuriousMachine
This project is being built in the context of the PDS Computer Science II course.  The files herein document the design and implementation of a Rube-Goldberg Machine (RGM).  This particular machine is called "Curious Machine" as per the Repository title, and is considered to be a product of Curious Robotics (TM).  Commits include, but are not limited to pictures and videos of the design process, prototypes and final structures made of foam, and or additive fabrication materials.  Later commits include OpenSCAD files for aforementioned additive fabrication components of the RGM, as well as Arduino files for the automated, Arduino driven aspects of the machine, which shall involve an electronic IO system, and a small robot designed to respond to said system.
